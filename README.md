How to use?

Firstly, download Webhook Embed.py (located in the repository) and Python (Mac: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5-macosx10.6.pkg Linux: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/Python-3.6.5.tar.xz Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5-amd64.exe )

After you have downloaded Webhook Embed.py and Python use the Python launcher to execute Webhook Embed.py

Webhook URL
The script will first ask for your webhook URL. This will be provided at the bottom of the webhook editing panel for the webhook. Make sure that you've also already set your webhook's profile picture and username.

Title and Description
The script will prompt for a title and description. This is the first two lines of every embed. Enter the corresponding answer.


Setting a Thumbnail
Setting a thumbnail is optional.

Fields
You can have up to 25 fields per embed, each with a custom name and content. Fields are also optional.

Embed Color
You will be prompted to enter a 6 digit hex key for the color of the embed. This is the left stripe of color.


If everything worked as planned, the bot will send a preview of the data being sent, and then the webhook will send the embed into the channel provided by the webhook creator.
